# User Experience

## Overview
Text-Based Choose Your Own Adventure Games have been around sense before PC's & Computers were mainstream. They first gained notoriety from the popular "Choose Your Own Adventure" gamebooks. The concept was first created by Edward Packard for his novel gamebooks designed for children to enjoy. In the modern age Choose Your Own Adventure games have taken on many forms. From Popular Video Games such as Telltales "The Walking Dead" & "The Wolf Among Us" to interactive shows such as Netflix's "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch". It is clear that Choose Your Own Adventure Games have been around for sometime and have taken on many different forms. It is for these reasons that I choose to create my own. The game itself is easy to play, the user is presented with a statement/question and is given multiple answers to choose from. The answers that they choose shape how there story plays out and users can find themselves discovering various endings based on their own choices. The fact that multiple endings are possible encourages the user to replay the game in an attempt to get an alternative outcome increasing overall viewtime of the site itself.
